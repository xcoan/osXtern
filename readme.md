# xcoan/osXtern
My code solutions for the 2018 Xtern class technical screening.

### Included Files
* `netxtern.rb` is meant to emulate browser functionality, including URL parsing and Back/Forward functionality.
* `group_reporting.rb` allows an admin to add users into the system with an appropriate group, and displays the newly added users by groups when done.
* `activity_monitor.rb` emulates an operating system's process manager.  The user enters numbers (Process ID's).  Repeat IDs are removed from the system (process termination).  The program prints any remaining processes after user-input is completed.
